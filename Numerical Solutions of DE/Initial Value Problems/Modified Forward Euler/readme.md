# Modified Forward Euler Method for Solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)

The **Modified Forward Euler Method** is a numerical technique used to approximate the solution of a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the form dy/dx = f(x, y). This method improves the accuracy of the standard forward Euler method by performing an iterative correction.

## Function Definitions

### Function `f_1(x: float, y: float) -> float`

This function defines a simple mathematical function 2x + y and returns the result. It takes two input parameters x and y, and returns the computed value of the function 2x + y.

### Function `modFEM(f: callable, h: float, a: float, b: float, y_a: float) -> list[float]`

The `modFEM` function implements the Modified Forward Euler Method for solving a first-order ODE dy/dx = f(x, y).

Parameters:

- `f (callable)`: The function representing the first-order ODE dy/dx = f(x, y).
- `h (float)`: The step size for discretizing the interval [a, b].
- `a (float)`: The initial value of x.
- `b (float)`: The final value of x.
- `y_a (float)`: The initial value of y at x = a.

Returns:

- `list[float]`: A list containing the approximate values of y for each step of the Modified Euler method.

## Algorithm Overview

1. The algorithm calculates the number of steps `n` based on the provided step size and interval.
2. An array `results` is initialized to store the approximate values of y.
3. The initial value of y is assigned to the first element of the `results` array.
4. For each step from 1 to `n-1`, the algorithm performs the following:
   - It calculates the next approximate value of y using the standard Forward Euler formula.
   - It performs an iterative correction to refine the approximation. The while loop iteratively updates the value of y until the difference between the current and previous approximations is within a specified tolerance (10e-5).
   - The final refined approximation is rounded to five decimal places.
5. The algorithm returns the list of approximate values of y.

## Example and Explanation

```python
def f_1(x: float, y: float) -> float:
    return 2 * x + y

# Using the modFEM function to solve the ODE dy/dx = 2x + y with the Modified Forward Euler Method.
approximate_values = modFEM(f_1, 0.2, 0, 1, 1)
print(approximate_values)
```

Output:

```bash
[1.0, 1.24, 1.44968, 1.73854, 2.11867, 2.60369]
```

In this example, the `modFEM` function is used to approximate the solution of the ODE dy/dx = 2x + y over the interval [0, 1] with a step size of 0.2. The function returns a list of approximate values of y at each step, demonstrating the accuracy improvement achieved by the Modified Forward Euler Method compared to the standard Forward Euler Method.

## Conclusion

The Modified Forward Euler Method is a valuable numerical technique for approximating solutions to first-order ordinary differential equations. It enhances the accuracy of the standard Forward Euler Method by iteratively refining the approximation at each step. This method is particularly useful for solving ODEs in various scientific and engineering applications.
