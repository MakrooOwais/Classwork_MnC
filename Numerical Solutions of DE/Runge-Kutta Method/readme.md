# Runge-Kutta Method - Explanation and Implementation

The **Runge-Kutta method** is a numerical technique for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) numerically. It's particularly useful for solving ODEs that can't be solved analytically. The method approximates the solution by breaking down the interval into smaller steps and computing the change in the dependent variable over each step.

## Key Concepts

Before diving into the implementation, let's understand the key concepts involved:

1. **Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)**: An equation that relates a function with its derivatives. It describes how a variable changes with respect to another variable.
2. **Initial Value Problem (IVP)**: Given an initial value for the function, find its values at various points using the ODE.
3. **Step Size (h)**: The interval at which the solution is computed.
4. **Order of the Method**: Determines the accuracy of the approximation.

## Implementation Explanation

### Function Definitions

The provided implementation includes two functions (`f_1` and `f_2`) representing the differential equations to be solved. They take `x` and `y` as inputs and return the corresponding values based on the equations.

### `rungeKuttaMethod` Function

The `rungeKuttaMethod` function takes the following inputs:

- `f`: The callable representing the differential equation.
- `a`: The initial value of the independent variable.
- `y_a`: The initial value of the dependent variable at `a`.
- `h`: The step size.
- `order`: The order of the Runge-Kutta method.

The function then uses the Runge-Kutta method to approximate the value of the dependent variable at a specific point. Here's how it works:

1. It defines the coefficients and coefficients for `k_i` based on the chosen order.
2. Calculates `k_i` values using the provided differential equation and coefficients.
3. Computes the result by combining the weighted `k_i` values.

The function returns the approximation of the dependent variable at the specified point.

### Example

For instance, consider the equation `dy/dx = -2xy^2` with the initial condition `y(0) = 1`. By using the Runge-Kutta method with an order of 4 and a step size of 0.2, the function approximates the value of `y` at `x = 0.2`.

### Conclusion

The Runge-Kutta method is a widely used technique for numerically solving ordinary differential equations. It provides a way to approximate the behavior of complex systems that can't be solved analytically. The implementation in the provided code follows the core principles of Runge-Kutta's algorithm: breaking down the problem into steps, evaluating functions at specific points, and combining these evaluations to approximate the solution. The method can be applied to various types of differential equations, making it an essential tool in scientific and engineering fields.
