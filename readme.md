## Introduction

As a student pursuing Mathematics and Computing, this repository serves as a portfolio of my academic projects and assignments. It focuses on two main areas of study: **Partial Differential Equations** and **Probability and Statistics**. The implementations are primarily done using Python and JavaScript.

## Partial Differential Equations

In this section, you will find Python and JavaScript implementations of solutions to various partial differential equations. These implementations cover different numerical methods and algorithms used to solve PDEs, such as finite difference methods, finite element methods, and more.

The code and accompanying documentation aim to provide clear explanations of the PDE problems, the chosen methods, and the resulting solutions. The implementations are structured in separate folders based on the specific PDE type and numerical technique employed.

## Probability and Statistics

In the Probability and Statistics section, I explore various concepts, theories, and applications of probability and statistical analysis using Python and JavaScript. This includes simulations, hypothesis testing, probability distributions, and data analysis.

The works showcased here demonstrate how to apply statistical principles to real-world problems and datasets. The code files are organized by topic, making it easy to navigate and find relevant materials.

## Getting Started

To access and explore the classwork, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mathematics-computing-classwork.git
```

## Usage

This repository is primarily intended for academic and educational purposes. You can review the implementations to understand how different PDEs and statistical concepts are tackled using Python and JavaScript. Feel free to use the code as a reference for your coursework and projects.

It is essential to remember that while this repository provides code solutions, you should strive to understand the underlying concepts and techniques fully. Plagiarism and academic misconduct are strictly discouraged.

## Contributing

As this is a personal repository for classwork, external contributions are generally not accepted. However, if you notice any issues, errors, or improvements that can be made to the code or documentation, you are welcome to open an issue or provide suggestions.
