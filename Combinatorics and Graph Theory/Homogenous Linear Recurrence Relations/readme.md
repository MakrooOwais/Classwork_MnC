# Homogeneous Linear Recurrence Relations - Implementation and Explanation

The provided code implements a class named `LinHomoRecRel` for solving **homogeneous linear recurrence relations**. Let's dive into the code and understand the concept of homogeneous linear recurrence relations and how this implementation works.

## Homogeneous Linear Recurrence Relations

A homogeneous linear recurrence relation is a mathematical equation that defines a sequence of numbers in terms of its previous terms. The general form of a homogeneous linear recurrence relation is:

$a_n = c_1 \cdot a_{n-1} + c_2 \cdot a_{n-2} + \ldots + c_k \cdot a_{n-k} $
where:

- $a_n$ is the $n$ th term of the sequence.
- $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k$ are constants.
- $k$ is the order of the recurrence relation.

## Class `LinHomoRecRel`

This class represents the implementation of solving homogeneous linear recurrence relations.

### Constructor `__init__(self, h: np.ndarray, order: int, coefficients: np.ndarray = None)`

- `h`: A numpy array representing the initial terms of the sequence.
- `order`: The order of the recurrence relation.
- `coefficients`: Optional. A numpy array representing the coefficients $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k$. If not provided, default values of 1 are used.

### Method `calc(self, n: int)`

This method calculates and returns the first $n$ terms of the sequence defined by the recurrence relation.

Inside the method:

1. A result array is created to store the terms of the sequence.
2. The initial terms $h$ are assigned to the beginning of the result array.
3. A loop calculates the subsequent terms using the recurrence relation and the provided coefficients (or default values).
4. The calculated sequence is returned as a numpy array.

## Example Usage

1. The first example demonstrates using the class to calculate Fibonacci numbers with the recurrence relation $F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)$. An instance of the class is created with initial terms `[1, 1]` and order `2`. The `calc` method is called to calculate the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

2. The second example demonstrates using the class to calculate a linear sequence with a custom recurrence relation and coefficients. An instance of the class is created with initial terms `[1, 2, 3]`, order `3`, and coefficients `[4, 8, 6]`. The `calc` method is called to calculate the first 10 terms of this sequence.

## Conclusion

Homogeneous linear recurrence relations are a fundamental concept in mathematics and have various applications in fields like combinatorics, number theory, and computer science. The implementation provided in the `LinHomoRecRel` class offers a convenient way to calculate terms of sequences defined by such recurrence relations, allowing users to explore and analyze these mathematical constructs with ease.
